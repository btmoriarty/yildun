"""voicelint: flag configured mechanical writing patterns.

The mechanical layer of Pherkad. A small, dependency-free linter that scans
prose (Markdown, plain text, or HTML) for the stylistic patterns configured in
its rule set: canned phrases, engagement-bait openers, filler intensifiers,
overused soft phrasings, dash overuse, over-used crutch words, and low-trust
source domains. The rules live in an external JSON config (voice_config.json)
so any person or team can tune them; the shipped defaults were built from tells
observed across many AI-assisted documents. No hit proves how a passage was
written; a hit means the configured pattern is present.

What this layer cannot see (antithesis constructions, triplet noun piling,
tone, direct-quote and technical-context judgment, whether prose sounds like
*you*) is the job of the Pherkad skill's judgment pass. The linter masks code
spans before matching, but it does not adjudicate quotations or domain context;
that stays with the model. See references/ai_tells.md.

Usage:
    voicelint.py FILE [FILE ...]
    voicelint.py -                 # read from stdin (treated as text)
    voicelint.py --html -          # treat stdin as HTML
    voicelint.py --config my.json FILE
    voicelint.py --json FILE       # machine-readable output
    voicelint.py --strict FILE     # warnings fail too (non-zero exit)

Exit status: 0 if clean; 1 if any error-level finding (or any warning with
--strict); 2 on a usage, IO, or config problem. That makes it safe in CI, where
a crash must not look like "findings found".

Stdlib only. Runs on Python 3.8+ (exercised in CI across 3.8 through 3.12).

    # Brian's standing rule is stronger than that and is stated as absolute: never write "the honest
    # answer / version / limit / truth / read / case / part / thing". It announces candour instead of
    # exercising it, it reads as a finding when it is a throat-clear, and it is nearly always
    # deletable, because the sentence after it is the thing.
    #
    # This check existed only in a downstream vendored copy, so the rule declared global was
    # enforced in exactly one repository and everywhere else it was a warning. That is the
    # failure mode a single source of truth exists to prevent, and it was found on 2026-09-01
    # when the phrase turned up at warning level in a document that should have been gated.

    # Narrow on purpose. The broad regex stays a warning because "honest broker" and "honest enough"
    # are ordinary; this pattern names the constructions that are always the tic.
